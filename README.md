# SOHCAHTOA
SOHCAHTOA is one of the most commonly used tools for understanding and calculating trig values in the context of right triangles.

SOHCAHTOA is an abbreviation used to remember the basic trigonometric relationships between the sides and angles in a right triangle. SOHCAHTOA represents the three main trigonometry formulas for calculating the sine, cosine, and tangent of the interior angles of a right triangle.

In SOHCAHTOA: 
1. Sin (Angle) = Opposite / Hypotenuse 
2. Cos (Angle) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse 
3. Tan (Angle) = Opposite / Adjacent

Here, "Opposite" refers to the length of the side opposite a given angle, "Adjacent" refers to the length of the side adjacent to the angle, and "Hypotenuse" is the longest side of a right triangle that is opposite the angle.

SOHCAHTOA is one of the most commonly used tools for understanding and calculating trig values in the context of right triangles. With these formulas in mind, you can calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent of the interior angles of a right triangle without using calculators. SOHCAHTOA is extremely useful in many math and science applications that involve trigonometry, such as physics, astronomy, and computer science.

Problems example: In a right triangle, MNO, the right angles are at corner O. The length of side MN is 10 cm, and the length of side MO is 6 cm. Find the length of side NO and determine the sin, cos, and tan values of angle M. 

Formula used: 
1. NO = âˆš(MN^2 + MO^2) (Pythagorean theorem for right triangles) 
2. Sin (M) = Opposite / Hypotenuse = MO / NNO 
3. Cos(M) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = MN / NO 
4. Tan (M) = Opposite / Adjacent = MO / MN

Answer: 
So, the length of side NO is 8.0 cm, the sin value of angle M is 0.51, the cos value of angle M is 0.86, and the tan value of angle M is 0.6.
